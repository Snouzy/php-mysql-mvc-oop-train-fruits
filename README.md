# Welcome to Snouz'fruits ! 
Itâ€™s a simulation of a user's fruits shopping card in order to have an introduction into object oriented programming of PHP in order to learn **Symfony**. It was cool, I learned a lot and did all the exercises successfully. This application is the end of my learning.

If you want to install the project, you just have to modify some variables in the `models/monPDO.php` file :
* ` HOST_NAME` : "`localhost`" if ur in a local env
* `DB_NAME` : The name of the table (i putted "`db_panierfruit`")
* `USER_NAME` : "`root`" if ur in a local env
* `PWD` : leave blank if ur in local
